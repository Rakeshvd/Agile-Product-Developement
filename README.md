As part of the project, you will live through various scenarios that a PM typically faces or is expected to carry out during the development phase:

* Create a project blueprint that can be used by either you or the involved stakeholders to understand their role, task and targeted milestone.

* Plan for a sprint meeting to ensure that the team is able to understand and focus on the deliverable.

* Respond to different scenarios that may require you to reprioritize the sprint backlog or manage expectations with stakeholders accordingly.

* Apply your learnings from the course to understand the API documentation and use this information to engage with the scrum team accordingly.
